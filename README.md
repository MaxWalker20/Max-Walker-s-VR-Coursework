## Max Walker's VR Coursework
### What it does 
This is a teaching tool designed to help young students learn the relationships between the pitches of two different sounds, and their harmonic relationships to eachother, specifically on the diatonic scale. Intervals between notes which are closer to low numbers have simpler ratios and are seen as more 'consonant' (eg. Perfect fifth; 3:2, Perfect octave; 2:1), as opposed to more complex fractions which are seen as more 'dischordant' (eg. Minor second; 16:15, Augmented fourth; 45:32).
 
By mapping these relationships on a sine wave, their relative complexities are given a more intuitive comparison in the form of the smoothness and relationships of the curves.
